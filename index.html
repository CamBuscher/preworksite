	<h1>Jogging with Cam</h1>
	<p class="expandedType">I started getting into running early in 2017. I started from essentially nothing, not being very active since high school, I could run a mile or two to start but that was it. I just started because I had felt kind of lazy in the months leading up to that. I worked evenings, so my mornings were spent playing video games or coding a bit, and occasionally I'd go play hockey. Then I would go to work and sit at a desk all day. It just began to feel kind of bad.</p>

		<h2>2017</h2>
		<p>I started getting addicted to running after my first organized race with some coworkers. Just a 5k that we got to run for free through a work sponsorship. Since then I've run a 10k and a half marathon, with plans to run my first full marathon in May. </p>
		<p>Starting out, my running schedule was sporadic and just random, kind of whatever I felt like on any given day. Now it's more scheduled and planned. I run five days of the week, and they look something like this.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>5-6 miles at an 8:30-8:45min/mile pace</li>
			<li>8-10 miles at an 8:30-8:45min/mile</li>
			<li>5 miles at an 8:00min/mile</li>
			<li>8-10 miles at an 8:30-8:45min/mile</li>
			<li>14-15 mile long run at a slightly slower pace of 9min/mile</li>
		</ul>
		<p> I'm definitely not a fast runner, I just can run for a long time. My goal is a 3 hour and 30 minute marathon, a slightly faster pace than my half marathon. To accomplish this one of my shorter runs will likely become some sort of speed training.</p>
